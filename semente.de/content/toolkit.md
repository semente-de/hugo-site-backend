semente consists of a set of tools and methods to help understand and act on collective processes, resources and dynamics. It differs from similar methods and frameworks in the way it focuses on a systems view of commonalities and difference, and in the use of circular metaphors inspired by the way diverse communities interpret the world and time.

Developed along several phases of cooperation, semente consists of a playspace and a set of action triggers. Documentation about its releases and past stages can be found on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/semente-de/documentation/), and current developments can be found in the [Lab](/lab).
