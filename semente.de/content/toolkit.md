semente consists of a set of tools and methods to help understand and act on collective processes, resources, and dynamics. It differs from similar methods and frameworks by focusing on a systems view of commonalities and differences, and in the use of circular metaphors inspired by the way communities worldwide interpret time, work, and the world.

- Learn more [about semente](../about).

Developed along several phases of cooperation, semente consists of a playspace, triggers, and movements. Documentation about its releases and past stages can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/semente-de/documentation/), and current developments can be found in the [Lab](/lab).
