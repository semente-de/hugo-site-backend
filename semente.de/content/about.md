semente is a toolkit for community initiatives. Based on decades of experience in open initiatives, collaboratives and transdisciplinary, semente offers concrete ways to create, visualise and improve commons-based action.

- Read more about the toolkit [here](/toolkit).

The first versions of semente were a result of collaboration between activists, designers, nonprofits and researchers in Brazil and Europe. It received support from the University of Bristol.
