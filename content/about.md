*semente* is a toolkit for community development. Based on decades of experience in open initiatives, collaborative actions and transdisciplinary methods, *semente* offers concrete ways to create, visualise and improve circular commons-based systems.

- Read more about the current version of the toolkit [here](/toolkit).

The tools and vision created by *semente* are result of ongoing collaborations between activists, designers, nonprofits and researchers in Brazil and Europe.
