semente (Portuguese for "seed") consists of a set of tools and methods to help communities understand and act on collective processes, resources, and dynamics. It focuses on a systems view of commonalities and differences, and in the use of circular metaphors inspired by the interaction between humans and nature. In that, *semente* honours to the ways communities worldwide interpret time, work, and the world.

In its first versions, developed collaboratively between 2022 and 2023 (read about the development [here](https://is.efeefe.me/stuff/seeds-digital-reforestation)), *semente* was based on a canvas with discrete fields inspired by the relationship of humans and plants. During the residency at GAIATO in 2025, that format was updated with a streamlined, spiralled shape. It will be published in March 2025.
