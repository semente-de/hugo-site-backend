semente Lab is our space of experimentation and reflection. In this page you'll find our research notes, thought experiments, musings and fast-paced reporting.

See also the [wiki pages](https://fonte.wiki/projetos/semente) about *semente* (in Portuguese), and this repository with [documentation](https://github.com/semente-de/documentation/) of its development.
