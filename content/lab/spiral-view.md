Going further on developing semente, we are now experimenting with different shapes for the canvas, as well as more consistent views of community dynamics. We expect to have new developments to show in the coming months. Open processual documentation is being published to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/semente-de/documentation/tree/main/0.3). As any good [Lab](../), though, live documentation of experimental processes is arguably too messy to navigate for those not involved in the processes. Parts of it make it to public posts like [this one on communities](../community-ways) and to a [wiki page](https://fonte.wiki/pt-br/projetos/semente) (in Portuguese). But we also have meeting notes, sketches, design boards, videos in Portuguese and other elements, most of which won't likely be incorporated at the end of the process.

However, as I worked on a particular working concept, I felt the need to make videos more intentionally - most of all to help me organise my thinking. This one is in English (with a quite poor vocabulary in some points... sorry for that!) and describes the spiralled shape I'm playing with these days, and how I see elements of community systems on it:

Editing the video already brought me insights that I will incorporate the next times I present it (in other words, I'm spiralling semente itself). All feedback is welcome.

**P.S.:** during an earlier attempt at documenting the experiments on paper, the camera on my phone failed. I ended up starting from scratch and made the video above. Afterwards, however, I thought it was worth making the original one public, even if incomplete. It's available from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/semente_paper-prototyping) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exaneu79dYc).
