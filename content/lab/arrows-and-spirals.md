Some weeks ago, I used my current working version of semente for an initial conversation / brainstorming session about a new project with fellow members of [GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org). I was glad to have two participants with a long experience on collaborative settings and community projects. That admittedly made me spend more time promoting a meta-discussion about shapes of project-making than properly shaping the new project. Though very fruitful in that context, I realised such an introduction would be too long for the current purposes of making semente leaner and more flexible. So as not to lose the reflection, though, I made a video with the full presentation of that part - a sort of critical conceptual exploration of spiral- vs. straight-arrow-shaped projects. As usual, the video is available from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/semente-arrows-and-spirals) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jit6GcCBqQ) (watch it below).
