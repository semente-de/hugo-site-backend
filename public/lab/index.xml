      <description>&lt;p&gt;True to its roots on decades of experience with collaborative initiatives, semente is fundamentally focused on communities. We do acknowledge, however, the ambiguity of that word. Communities can, after all, be considered places of safety as much as sites of homogeneity and constraint. Inclusion and care, as well as exclusion and prejudice. Of course, there is no precise and universal definition of what communities are. To clarify its meaning to us, we share some practice-based reflections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Felipe (semente) and Ed King (University of Bristol) were invited by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kwmc.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Knowle West Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the first of a new series of events. It was titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/what-if-tickets-1015221824807&#34;&gt;What if&amp;hellip;? Seeds of Tomorrow Growing Today&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Knowle West is a media centre with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kwmc.org.uk/about/history/&#34;&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; of community-oriented projects. The event was &amp;ldquo;a collective exploration of community tech plus arts. A place to grow connections and be inspired by the seeds of possible tomorrows happening today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
